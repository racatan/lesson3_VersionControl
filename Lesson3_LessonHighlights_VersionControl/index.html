            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a system that allows you to keep track of all the past versions of a file you’ve created. It takes a snapshot and records all the changes to a file you’ve made. It is one main repository for all the project files. A VCS is much more efficient and easier than saving the file multiple times with different names. Graphic and web designers would find a VCS handy because they could go back to previous files and compare changes that have made. It is also good for multiple people working on one project. Team members can look back at their own files or other team member’s files, edit them, and check them back it.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Advantages</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control systems have many advantages. They automatically keep track of who changed the files, when they were changed, what was changed, and why it was changed. If you screw things up or accidently lose a file, you can easily recover it because files cannot be overwritten. All the files are held in one place, the repository. Another advantage is that people can work on the same file and the same time without any conflict. The biggest thing about this is that it allows you to unify or merge what two or more people working on in the same file.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Types</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local version control system helps people remember which directory they are in so they do not write to the wrong file or copy over other files on accident. The local VCS have a very simple database that keeps all the changes to a file under a revision control. Centralized version control systems where made so that people can collaborate with developers on other systems. The systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. An advantage of a centralized VCS is that everyone knows to some degree what everyone else on the project is doing and administrators have control over who can do what. A disadvantage is that if the server goes down, nobody can do their work. In a distributed version control system clients do not just check out the latest snapshots of a file, they fully mirror the repository. Therefore is the server dies, the client repositories can still be backed up.</p>

            <h2 class="featurette-heading">Git
                <span class="text-muted">The Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The way Git thinks about the data makes it stands out from other VCS. Most VCS store information as a list of file-based changes. The information they keep is thought of as a set of files and the changes made to each file. Git thinks of data as a set of snapahots of a miniature file system. Every time you commit it takes a picture of what all your files look like and stores a reference snapshot. But if files have not change, Git does not store them again. Nearly ever option is local on Git. You usually don not need information from another computer on your network, just local files and resources to operate. Git has integrity, meaning that you are unable to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"><i>Git init</i> turns a directory into a new Git repository so you are able to start version controlling it. <i>Git add</i> adds content from the working into the stating area to get ready to commit it. <i>Git status</i> shows you the different states of the files in your working directory and staging area, which files are unstaged and which files are staged and not commited. <i>Git commit</i> records a new permanent snapshot, but only to the files in the staging area. <i>Git reset</i> is mainly used to undo things. <i>Git rm</i> is used to remove files from the staging area and working directory. <i>Git clean</i> is used to remove files that you do not want in your working directory.</p>
